# SatelliteScope

SatelliteScope is an interactive platform designed to visualize satellite movements and how they interact with Earth and its surroundings. Users can explore 3D models of satellites, track their orbits, and gain a better understanding of satellite trajectories and interactions in space. 

Note: SatelliteScope is currently in beta, meaning that not all features are available yet and the platform is still under development. You may encounter missing features or incomplete functionality as we continue to improve the platform.

Features

Satellite Orbit Visualization: Track and visualize satellite movements around Earth in a 3D space.

Satellite Data: Each satellite model, such as Jason 3, comes with detailed information about its mission and trajectory.

Satellite Name Tags: Satellites are labeled with custom tags (e.g., Jason 3), making them easy to identify.

Usage

Navigating the 3D Space: Use your mouse or keyboard controls to explore the 3D space and observe satellite orbits.

Tracking Satellites: Click on satellites like Jason 3 to see their orbit paths and access detailed satellite information.

Orbit Path: Satellites have interactive lines that trace their movement around Earth.

Modals and Interactions: Information about each satellite is available in modals that pop up when you click on a satellite. Close the modal using the button provided.
